## Laravel 4.x Starter Template

### A Framework For Web Artisans

[Official Documentation](http://four.laravel.com) (Under Active Development)

### Starter Template Usage
#####Clone the template wherever you want to start your project.

		git clone https://github.com/niallobrien/laravel4-template.git name-of-project
		cd name-of-project

This is a good starting point for Laravel 4 projects as I've included some extra helpful packages (more on this later).

#####Install Composer inside your project directory.
		curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

#####Install all required packages.
		php composer.phar install

#####Git to work! :)

### Added Packages
Included are Meido's Form and HTML classes, which are direct ports from Laravel 3.
Really Big Elephant released a nice String class, that does much more than a port of Str released by Meido, so that's included here instead. Note, the class alias is **String** not **Str** as you may be used to from Laravel 3.
